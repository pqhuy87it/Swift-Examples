# DragAndDrop-CollectionView

With the release of iOS-11, Apple introduced Drag and Drop in UITableView and UICollection with a specialized API that works on the concept of Interactions (something like gestures). 

UITableView and UICollectionView have similar APIs to support Drag and Drop with some small differences. So, in this sample I'll be showing how you can integrate drag and drop in UICollectionView.
