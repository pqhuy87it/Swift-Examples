This is a simple newsfeed app. In this app, you can check your friends photos, and the system suggests you more people to follow.

The architecture is quite simple, too:

I'll share how to use MVVM with protoocl techniques to simplify the table view and make the resposibility straightfoward and clear in my article [Advanced iOS tutorial: Use MVVM to tackle complicated TableView](https://blog.flawlessapp.io/advanced-mvvm-tableview-tutorial/).

The code here is advanced example which adds more result (command) patterns and a tableview-with-sections practice. Feel free to check the [starter branch](https://github.com/koromiko/TheGreatWall/tree/starter), which might be helpful for clarifying concepts of the MVVM pattern and the separation of concerns.
